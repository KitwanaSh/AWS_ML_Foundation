## Creating A Python Package From Scratch
This Project was part of the Machine Learning Foundation learning process.
The purpose of this exercise is to get introduced to the practice of object oriented programming.
Not many people are able to create a package. That is why this is a milestone that i can be much proud of.
As a student, was required to create a python package that will deal with statistical distributions like:
- Gaussian distribution
- Binomial Distribution
The purpose for this project is to learn how to create a python package by going through the use of:
- Classes
- Objects
- Methods
- Attributes
- inheritance
- Magic methods
By assuming i had a basic knowlege of **Statistic**, i was able to put these knowleges in practice to build first
a class for a __Normal Distribution__ then i created another class for a __Binomial Distribution__.
These two distributions classes were created first in two different little projects. Then after i
merged them together to have one project using the *inherictance* method we learned earlier in the course.
When these two classes were combined, then i made this project a package and pushed it to [pypi](https://pypi.org).
### Software needed for this project
In order to work with this project, which you are thoroughly free to clone, you need to have python in your
computer already installed, preferably the version 3.7 or above.
Or another alternative is to have the latest version of anaconda installed.
Therefore, you might need to have jupyter notebook in order to work on predifined projects. However, in order to
create a package, must work on your project by dividing it into module and they have to in a .py format.
